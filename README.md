# AutoBenchmark

## Goal

The primary goal of the autobenchmark project is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for benchmarking large language models quantized by the llama.cpp project. By automating the benchmarking process and supporting multiple widely-used benchmarks, the project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to evaluate the trade-offs between model quality and quantization levels across different LLM models and quants, and also build a community space for sharing benchmark results, something similar to the LLM leaderboard.

This is a quality benchmark, not a performance benchmark.
